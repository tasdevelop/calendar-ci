	Stimulsoft Reports.PHP (JS version) - How to Activate
	<hr><br>

	The Trial version of the product does not contain any restrictions, except for the Trial watermark on the report pages.<br><br>
	
	To activate the product, it is enough to copy the 'license.key' file to the 'stimulsoft' subfolder of this project (in the same place, where is the 'license.php' file is located). The license will be loaded automatically. You can add some conditions in the 'license.php' script to load the license file, if it required for security.
